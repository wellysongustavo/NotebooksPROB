The values in distribution B  show some variability — they are not all identical, and the values can be either 8 or 0. **If we were to quantify variability**, we could assign a value of 0 to A to indicate that it has no variability. But **what variability value should we assign to distribution B?**\n","\n","We need a measure to summarize the **variability** of these two distributions. The summary metrics we've learned so far don't tell us anything about variability. The **mean**, the **median**, and the **mode** of distribution A are all 4, and distribution B has a **mean** and a **median** of 4, and **no mode**. If we were to judge variability based on these values, we'd probably have to conclude that the variabilities of the two distributions are equal, which is wrong.\n","\n","One intuitive way to measure the variability of a distribution is to find the **difference between the maximum and the minimum value**. Both the maximum and the minimum of distribution  A is 4, so the variability of distribution  is 0:\n","\n","$$\n","max(A) - min(A) = 4 - 4 = 0\n","$$\n","\n","We call this measure of variability the **range**.
